          <i>Tricks</i><br />There's things tht need time to take decision And
          then there is tht shouldn't need tht time and at those times use 5
          second rule or toss a coin<br />the 5 second rule is just you taking a
          break and at the end of those seconds,
          <br />
          whatever decision hangs on your head mus be taken<br />And the coin
          toss trick is not that u take the decision by head or tails but
          actually when u toss the coin,<br />
          the moment before it hits the ground you will surely think of the
          decision that u really want to take by heart

          Average life expectancy maybe 79.6years <br />but the actual living is
          17.5 years (sleep,eating,drinking,old age,non-consciousness take away
          the other time) Now, knowing this will be of your advantage to face
          life and an easy reminder that: sad or happy, enjoy each moment !!

          And one of the most common ways to attain such relaxation in fierce

          bad situations is to learn about Empathy and Perspective,<br /><img

          The main way or one of the major ways to prepare that point of view is
          by analogy ..(think of an example that suits the situation best)<a

        The Harshad Mehta scam of 1992 was one of the biggest financial scandals in India. It involved market manipulation
        and fraudulent activities that led to a significant stock market crash. SEBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of
        India, played a crucial role in reforming the stock market and introducing new regulations to prevent such scams in
        the future.<br />

          Fun Facts are pretty random to pop out of nowhere<br />
          even when we are enduring hardships and struggles in our life. Say,
          like how you come across random ads while watching TV <br />
          or playing Ad implied games etc or like the ad that has popped right
          below this Text<br />
          <script type="text/javascript">
            atOptions = {
              key: "711e7af8d7e5cf9bbef407f704f19994",
              format: "iframe",
              height: 300,
              width: 160,
              params: {},
            };
            document.write(

                "ipt>"
            );
          </script>
          And just like the above ad, you must ignore those fun facts that hurt
          or disturb you,<br />
          or should use it for the very sake of it!! Fun and drop ladies and
          gentlemen.<br />
          As i said earlier perspective matters,<br />
          yet another example image for you down below, but this time watch
          closely(tilt phone upside down) <br />
          <img
            src="media/images/perspective2.jpg"
            width="400"
            height="400"
          /><br />
          Did you find the trick??, hope you did!<br />
          just like the above image, life sometimes may seem hard and unruly no
          matter<br />
          which direction or way of approach you may make and take<br />
          At those times, you must not fade away rather bounce back and say "is
          that all you've got?!!(reference:Thor,avengers")<br />
          Dont shout, i can hear your, "HOW!!"<br />
          that is life, figuring it out is your adventure but if you wana drop
          dead as a weakling(unlike Thor) you always have a choice mate<br />
          if you cant approach it anyway, then let it slide, flow, crash<br />
          And once you get the slightest hint, go at it!!, crash it back!!,
          harder and twice as it did.

      <h2 id="Toxic">Toxic Relationship</h2>
      <li>
        <i>Toxic relationships are at times just "One-sided relationships"</i
        ><br />
        -How to Move Forward in a One-sided Relationship If you feel that you're
        in an imbalanced relationship, Campbell suggests documenting your time
        and making a concrete list of observations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If after making these observations, you feel that things are one-sided,
        you need to communicate your feelings with your partner who otherwise
        won't know that a problem exists.and if it still pertains cut ties with
        the partner
      </li>
      <li>
        However, initiating change can be the hardest part of navigating a
        one-sided relationship. "The problem with one-sided relationships is
        that often it is just one partner initiating these 'talks' because being
        in what we call an over-benefitted situation (getting more out of a
        relationship than you are putting in) can be quite comfortable,"
        Campbell explains. "So your partner may not respond favorably to the
        complaint."
      </li>
      <li>
        In fact, "researchers call this pattern 'demand-withdrawal,' which
        involves one partner is initiating a discussion or requesting a change
        and the other withdrawing from the conversation and avoiding
        discussion," she elaborates.1Ôªø It's a very unhealthy and a common
        pattern in one-sided relationships. "If the over-benefitted cares about
        the other's well-being, they will seek to improve the balance and take
        on more of the work or put in more effort," says Campbell.
      </li>
      <li>
        "If a partner does not change after being made aware of the imbalance,
        the partnership might not be a good fit and the under-benefitted person
        should consider moving on," she adds.

        <b><i>Explaination</i></b
        ><br />
        The point about the animation is this. There are two individuals,
        apparently doing likewise work.<br />

        One looks glad and the other is extremely pitiful. One is doing things
        the most difficult way possible, and one is doing things the simple way.
        <br />
        <li id="work">
          <b><i>Smart way</i></b
          ><br />

          The simple route is to work first. Get some cash. Everyone needs to
          bring in cash, and except if you acquired it, a great many people need
          to work. <br />

          Nonetheless, when you are acquiring, begin bringing in your cash work
          for you, instead of zeroing in on working for cash. <br />
        </li>
        <li id="better">
          <b><i>Betterment of Society or Surrounding</i></b
          ><br />

          It can get going little from the outset. Two or three hundred dollars
          or pounds to a great extent. <br />

          In the event that you start soon enough, you can collect a tremendous
          pot of cash at retirement. <br />

          There are alternate approaches to bring in cash work for you also,
          remembering contributing for appreciating and income creating
          resources. The fact of the matter is, in the event that you buckle
          down for cash, however spend that cash on things that will go down in
          esteem and won't ever deliver income, you will consistently be once
          again at the starting point. <br />
        </li>
        <li id="know">
          <b><i>Know Better</i></b
          ><br />

          That doesn't mean paid and difficult work is terrible. It gives
          individuals reason.<br />

          No one can tell when your wellbeing will go however.<br />
          So when you can begin reinvesting cash from that work, into future
          income, the sooner you have more alternatives

          Your body isn't yours <br />
          It's prolly ur parents' (if u don't believe in God)<br />
          Or it's ur creator's(ur God)<br />
          So if u wana die for your friends sake and ur tht pure of it ...<br />
          Then u might as well take ur body and soul as ur other friend who
          deserves ur attention too..<br />
          Don't treat it like u own it and it's u.. it ain't u if u don't look
          after it like u should ..<br />
          It isn't selfish.. it's taking care of tht body and soul given to u..
          just like a friend<br />
          So, DEEP breath and know that you are worthy of yourself.
