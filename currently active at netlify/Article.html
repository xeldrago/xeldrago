              <p>There's things that need time to take decision, and then there are things that shouldn't need that
                time. At those times, use the 5 second rule or toss a coin.</p>
              <p>The 5 second rule is just you taking a break and at the end of those seconds, whatever decision hangs
                on your head must be taken.</p>
              <p>And the coin toss trick is not that you take the decision by head or tails but actually when you toss
                the coin, the moment before it hits the ground you will surely think of the decision that you really
                want to take by heart.<a href="dice.html" class="ent-button red-gradient">

              <h3>Time Perspective - A Reality Check Backed by Research</h3>
              <p>Basically, Average life expectancy in many countries may sit around 79–80 years, but studies on “time-use analysis” from the
              American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and research published in Social Indicators Research show that nearly two-thirds of that
              lifespan is spent on sleep, routine maintenance, illness, commuting, and unconscious aging states. In other words, the
              truly experiential part of life—the part where you actively feel, choose, express, and live—is much smaller, often
              hovering around 16–20 active years of conscious living. This reframing aligns with findings from psychologist Daniel
              Kahneman on “experienced time” vs. “remembered time,” where the mind compresses life into fewer meaningful segments.
              
              Knowing this works to your advantage: it shrinks the emotional weight of problems. If life’s truly lived moments are so
              limited, then sadness and stress become temporary guests, not lifelong tenants. Research from the Journal of Positive
              Psychology confirms that adopting a “finite-time perspective” reduces anxiety and increases present-moment appreciation.</p>

            <article class="card" id="relax">
              <h3>Relax</h3>
              <p>Don't think too much... you feel and experience what you think... so stop... breathe. Relax... Don't
                pressure yourself... no one's dying bud (got your 17 years yet) and some research :This ties directly into emotional regulation science. Studies from Harvard Medical School and Stanford’s Center for
                Stress & Health show that overthinking amplifies stress responses, while conscious breathing and cognitive defusion
                reduce perceived threat in under 60 seconds. Simply put: you feel what you repeatedly think. Pause. Breathe. Reset.
                Nothing catastrophic is happening — and according to psychological research, this micro-reset is enough to break the
                mental loop.
                
                So remember: whether sad or happy, life’s fraction is tiny. Enjoy the moments that actually count — because science
                agrees, you really do have only ~17 years of fully conscious experience, and they are worth living without pressure.</p>

              <p>The Harshad Mehta scam of 1992 was one of the biggest financial scandals in India. It involved market
                manipulation and fraudulent activities that led to a significant stock market crash. SEBI, the
                Securities and Exchange Board of India, played a crucial role in reforming the stock market and
                introducing new regulations to prevent such scams in the future.</p>

            <article class="card">
              <h3>Nothing is ever too dumb for life</h3>
              <p>Because we literally just pay to see other human beings (movies, airplane tickets, through specs, heck
                even prostitution).</p>
            </article>

            <article class="card">
              <p>Fun Facts are pretty random to pop out of nowhere even when we are enduring hardships and struggles in
                our life. Say, like how you come across random ads while watching TV or playing Ad implied games etc.
              </p>
              <p>And just like ads, you must ignore those fun facts that hurt or disturb you, or should use it for the
                very sake of it! Fun and drop ladies and gentlemen.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier perspective matters, yet another example image for you down below, but this time

              <p>Did you find the trick? Hope you did!</p>
              <p>Just like the above image, life sometimes may seem hard and unruly no matter which direction or way of
                approach you may make and take. At those times, you must not fade away rather bounce back and say "is
                that all you've got?!!"</p>
              <p>Don't shout, I can hear your "HOW!!" That is life, figuring it out is your adventure but if you wanna
                drop dead as a weakling you always have a choice mate. If you can't approach it anyway, then let it
                slide, flow, crash. And once you get the slightest hint, go at it!! Crash it back!! Harder and twice as
                it did.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Relationship</h2>
          <div class="card-container">
            <article class="card">
              <h3>Toxic relationships are at times just "One-sided relationships"</h3>
              <p>How to Move Forward in a One-sided Relationship: If you feel that you're in an imbalanced relationship,
                Campbell suggests documenting your time and making a concrete list of observations.</p>
              <p>If after making these observations, you feel that things are one-sided, you need to communicate your
                feelings with your partner who otherwise won't know that a problem exists. And if it still pertains, cut
                ties with the partner.</p>
              <p>However, initiating change can be the hardest part of navigating a one-sided relationship. "The problem
                with one-sided relationships is that often it is just one partner initiating these 'talks' because being
                in what we call an over-benefitted situation (getting more out of a relationship than you are putting
                in) can be quite comfortable," Campbell explains. "So your partner may not respond favorably to the
                complaint."</p>
              <p>In fact, "researchers call this pattern 'demand-withdrawal,' which involves one partner initiating a
                discussion or requesting a change and the other withdrawing from the conversation and avoiding
                discussion," she elaborates. It's a very unhealthy and a common pattern in one-sided relationships. "If
                the over-benefitted cares about the other's well-being, they will seek to improve the balance and take
                on more of the work or put in more effort," says Campbell.</p>
              <p>"If a partner does not change after being made aware of the imbalance, the partnership might not be a
                good fit and the under-benefitted person should consider moving on," she adds.</p>

              <p>Nonetheless, when you are acquiring, begin bringing in your cash work for you, instead of zeroing in on

              <p>There are alternate approaches to bring in cash work for you also, remembering contributing for
                appreciating and income creating resources. The fact of the matter is, in the event that you buckle down
                for cash, however spend that cash on things that will go down in esteem and won't ever deliver income,
                you will consistently be once again at the starting point.</p>

              <p>Your body isn't yours. It's probably your parents' (if you don't believe in God) or it's your creator's
                (your God).</p>
              <p>So if you wanna die for your friend's sake and you're that pure of it... Then you might as well take
                your body and soul as your other friend who deserves your attention too.</p>
              <p>Don't treat it like you own it and it's you... it ain't you if you don't look after it like you should.
                It isn't selfish... it's taking care of that body and soul given to you... just like a friend.</p>
              <p>So, DEEP breath and know that you are worthy of yourself.</p>
