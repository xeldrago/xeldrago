              <h3>Tricks</h3>
              <p>There's things that need time to take decision, and then there are things that shouldn't need that
                time. At those times, use the 5 second rule or toss a coin.</p>
              <p>The 5 second rule is just you taking a break and at the end of those seconds, whatever decision hangs
                on your head must be taken.</p>
              <p>And the coin toss trick is not that you take the decision by head or tails but actually when you toss
                the coin, the moment before it hits the ground you will surely think of the decision that you really
                want to take by heart.</p>

              <h3>Time Perspective</h3>
              <p>Average life expectancy maybe 79.6 years but the actual living is 17.5 years (sleep, eating, drinking,
                old age, non-consciousness take away the other time). Now, knowing this will be of your advantage to
                face life and an easy reminder that: sad or happy, enjoy each moment!</p>

            <article class="card">
              <p>The Harshad Mehta scam of 1992 was one of the biggest financial scandals in India. It involved market
                manipulation and fraudulent activities that led to a significant stock market crash. SEBI, the
                Securities and Exchange Board of India, played a crucial role in reforming the stock market and
                introducing new regulations to prevent such scams in the future.</p>

              <h3>Nothing is ever too dumb for life</h3>
              <p>Because we literally just pay to see other human beings (movies, airplane tickets, through specs, heck
                even prostitution).</p>
            </article>

            <article class="card">
              <p>Fun Facts are pretty random to pop out of nowhere even when we are enduring hardships and struggles in
                our life. Say, like how you come across random ads while watching TV or playing Ad implied games etc.
              </p>
              <p>And just like ads, you must ignore those fun facts that hurt or disturb you, or should use it for the
                very sake of it! Fun and drop ladies and gentlemen.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier perspective matters, yet another example image for you down below, but this time
                watch closely (tilt phone upside down).</p>

              <p>Did you find the trick? Hope you did!</p>
              <p>Just like the above image, life sometimes may seem hard and unruly no matter which direction or way of
                approach you may make and take. At those times, you must not fade away rather bounce back and say "is
                that all you've got?!!"</p>
              <p>Don't shout, I can hear your "HOW!!" That is life, figuring it out is your adventure but if you wanna
                drop dead as a weakling you always have a choice mate. If you can't approach it anyway, then let it
                slide, flow, crash. And once you get the slightest hint, go at it!! Crash it back!! Harder and twice as
                it did.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Relationship</h2>
          <div class="card-container">
            <article class="card">
              <h3>Toxic relationships are at times just "One-sided relationships"</h3>
              <p>How to Move Forward in a One-sided Relationship: If you feel that you're in an imbalanced relationship,
                Campbell suggests documenting your time and making a concrete list of observations.</p>
              <p>If after making these observations, you feel that things are one-sided, you need to communicate your
                feelings with your partner who otherwise won't know that a problem exists. And if it still pertains, cut
                ties with the partner.</p>
              <p>However, initiating change can be the hardest part of navigating a one-sided relationship. "The problem
                with one-sided relationships is that often it is just one partner initiating these 'talks' because being
                in what we call an over-benefitted situation (getting more out of a relationship than you are putting
                in) can be quite comfortable," Campbell explains. "So your partner may not respond favorably to the
                complaint."</p>
              <p>In fact, "researchers call this pattern 'demand-withdrawal,' which involves one partner initiating a
                discussion or requesting a change and the other withdrawing from the conversation and avoiding
                discussion," she elaborates. It's a very unhealthy and a common pattern in one-sided relationships. "If
                the over-benefitted cares about the other's well-being, they will seek to improve the balance and take
                on more of the work or put in more effort," says Campbell.</p>
              <p>"If a partner does not change after being made aware of the imbalance, the partnership might not be a
                good fit and the under-benefitted person should consider moving on," she adds.</p>

              <p>There are alternate approaches to bring in cash work for you also, remembering contributing for
                appreciating and income creating resources. The fact of the matter is, in the event that you buckle down
                for cash, however spend that cash on things that will go down in esteem and won't ever deliver income,
                you will consistently be once again at the starting point.</p>

              <p>You put down yourself too much sometimes that you sacredly believe that you'd just die for someone who
                is better (lol due to low self esteem).</p>
              <p>Your body isn't yours. It's probably your parents' (if you don't believe in God) or it's your creator's
                (your God).</p>
              <p>So if you wanna die for your friend's sake and you're that pure of it... Then you might as well take
                your body and soul as your other friend who deserves your attention too.</p>
              <p>Don't treat it like you own it and it's you... it ain't you if you don't look after it like you should.
                It isn't selfish... it's taking care of that body and soul given to you... just like a friend.</p>
              <p>So, DEEP breath and know that you are worthy of yourself.</p>
